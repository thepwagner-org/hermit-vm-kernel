# hermit-guest-kernel

This is a debian-bullseye kernel used for [hermit-ci](https://github.com/thepwagner/hermit).

Configuration is based on [firecracker's default kernel configuration](https://github.com/firecracker-microvm/firecracker/blob/8be922692b03f1240a3ed2ae4b144b086963416d/resources/microvm-kernel-x86_64.config), with all new settings defaulted.
